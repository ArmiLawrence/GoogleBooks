# GoogleBooks

This app is a book search engine that allows a user to enter a Title in the Book Title field. Once the Search button is clicked, the user will see books related to the title they entered cascade in the screen. The user is also able to save books for future enjoyment. The View button allows the user to go to the Google Books link associated with their title and they can see ratings, related books, etc.
